 **Scripts**
 -Im also planning to include JavaScript as well, so that client-side validation
 code will also be included automatically based on the following:

*based on the DATA_TYPE we already know what type of data will be accepted by a specific input
to be generated.
 - if DATA_TYPE is date a text field with a datepicker is created

*based on the COLUMN_KEY we already know whether to include the fields on the form or not.
 - if there's no key definitely include
 - if key is PRI then create a hidden element for it and attach data via JavaScript

*based on the CHARACTER_OCTET_LENGTH:
 - validation or setting on how many characters can be accepted by an input(of course only text fields are affected by this)
 - I think range can also be set on html so there's no need for js


 //php script
 -plain php
 -codeigniter integration
 -upload controller file and it will automatically generate code

 //scenario for generating form
 - edit config.php for database information
 - edit js/config.js for default form elements for specific data types
 - input the filename to be used when the form is generated
 - select database
 - select tables
 - select fields to include in the form (only one form at a time)
 - input form name
 - input the name of the action file, if both the html code and action will be on the same file then leave it blank

Form Guide:
*only one form can be generated at a time
*if hidden is checked, field type becomes hidden
*content is editable
*clicking on the field allows you to customize the form
 *you can customize whether the form is hidden or not, fields which are primary key are hidden by default, hidden fields are greyed out in the form preview
 *form type can be any of the existing form types: email, text, select, radio, checkbox, button, submit, textarea, url, tel num, number, file upload
